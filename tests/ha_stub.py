"""Just enough of Home Assistant for the modules that import it to load.

The coordinator and the entity platforms import Home Assistant at module level,
and the suite runs without it. What they touch at import time is small: a
coordinator base class, its failure exception, the entity base classes and the
device class enum. These stand-ins cover exactly that, and only when Home
Assistant itself is not installed; where it is, the modules load against the
real thing and the tests that build on the stand-ins adapt rather than fail.

The interval timer is recorded instead of started, which is what lets a test
drive the control manager's keepalive by hand. The recorder is a module level
function so that ``record_timers`` can patch it in under a real Home Assistant
too, where the real timer would ask a stand-in ``hass`` for its event loop. The
one thing a real core cannot give a test without a running instance is the
coordinator base class: its constructor asks the frame helper, so the fixtures
that build a coordinator call ``skip_unless_stubbed`` and sit the run out.
