"""Display rows and alarms under a real Home Assistant core (L3, R30).

Two things the ordinary suite cannot see end to end. A display row that reads
CTC's "not fitted" marker at set-up gets no entity until it first leaves a
number, and then gets it through async_add_entities with no reload; and a
registry entry for a row that is no longer on a page the menu still has is
removed, while one for a page the menu does not know is left alone. And the
alarm the panel prints in its header icon becomes the sensor Senaste larm and
an episode on the binary Larm, with the outdoor temperature Modbus had.

Shares the stand-ins and fixtures of test_homeassistant.py and runs the same
way, from a virtual environment that has Home Assistant and
pytest-homeassistant-custom-component installed:

    python -m pytest -o asyncio_mode=auto tests/test_homeassistant_rows_alarms.py
