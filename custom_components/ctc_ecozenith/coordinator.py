"""Update coordinators for the two transports.

The Modbus coordinator is the workhorse: it reads the documented registers in
contiguous blocks, it has no side effects and it runs on a short interval.

The web coordinator harvests the values Modbus does not expose. Reading a page
other than the one on the panel means navigating there, which moves the physical
display, so it runs rarely, it checks first whether somebody is using the panel,
and it puts the panel back when it is done.

    The 1000 block is write only and the controller forgets it roughly five

    An override counts as in force only from a write that reached the unit, and

    Writes take time, and two things can happen while one is on its way. A
    newer value for the same address: sets and the refresh take turns behind
    one lock, an address at a time, so a refresh never writes an older value
    over a newer one. A release, from the button, a select or the entry being
    unloaded: those cannot wait for the lock, so the state is read again when
    the write is done, and a write that was overtaken by a release records
    nothing. The controller may then hold the value for its five minutes, but
