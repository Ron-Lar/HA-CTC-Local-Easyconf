"""Binary sensors derived from the Modbus status registers.

An enum register is judged by its code, never by its label. The label is a
Swedish string that may be reworded or translated one day, and a binary that
compared against it would then go quietly off for good; the code is what the
controller actually said. The coordinator keeps the codes beside the labels for
exactly this.
