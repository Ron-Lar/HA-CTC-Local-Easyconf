Screen and text numbering differs between models, an i255 and an i550 Pro do not

@dataclass
class MenuReading:
    """What one walk through the display's menu came back with.

    ``pages`` is what was found. ``complete`` says whether that is the whole
    operation data subtree: the root was found and verified, the root was
    regained after every tap, and every page the sweep knew of was reached
    again for its own strip. The tap budget does not count against it, since
    the same menu spends it the same way every time.

    A reading that is not complete is still worth offering, but it is not the
    menu: a page that only the interrupted part of the sweep would have found
    is simply absent from it, and writing it in place of a stored menu would
    make that page, and its entities, disappear until the next release. So
    the readers that fold a reading into a stored menu treat an incomplete one
    as a reading still owed, and nothing stamps the version for it.

    ``gaps`` names the pages the sweep reached but did not read whole: a
    screen whose widgets would not come, or a caption the catalogue would not
    give up, which renames the row it belonged to (see :class:`PageValues`).
    Such a page is left out of ``pages`` and makes the reading incomplete,
    for the same reason an unreached page does: written in place of the
    stored page it would give a row a name it does not have. Before the keys
    followed the row's place (roadmap L2) that also took the row's entity
    with it, VSH's delivered heat counter among the rows that have read that
    way; now the entity stays, but the counter is found by its name, so the
    coefficient of performance would still lose it until the next reading.

    The walk also says how far it got (roadmap L6): whether the home screen
    was recognised, whether the operation data tile was found on it, whether
    pressing the tile led into the menu, and, where the display stopped
    answering partway, what it said. A walk that ends in nothing used to look
    the same whichever step failed, which is how an i360 could stand without
    a page read through several releases with nobody able to say why. The
    steps are None on a reading the sweep did not make, such as the empty
    one a caller puts in place of a walk that could not start, and a step is
    None where the display stopped answering before the walk got to try it:
    a display that does not answer is not one whose home screen or tile is
    missing, and the report, which carries the steps but not the error, would
    otherwise say the same no for both (F3.1). A walk that went its whole way
    says no for a step it did not reach.

    The panel moves while this runs and is put back where it started. Only the

    and verified. That subtree is read only on every CTC model checked, so a
    tap landing slightly off cannot change a setting; the menus around it are
    not, and a panel left in Avancerat or on a settings page must not be swept.
    So where the root cannot be found, no page control is pressed: the page
    the panel is showing is read as it stands and offered on its own, or, with
    ``require_root``, nothing is offered at all. The search for the root does
    press the panel's own back button on its way towards the home screen; that
    is the chrome, which navigates and never acts. The two readers that fold a
    reading into a stored menu ask for the root, since one page in place of
    the whole menu would be a loss, not a reading.

    Layout differs between models: an i255 puts a tab strip along the bottom, an
    i550 Pro does not. Rather than guess, every plausible control on the root
    page is tried once and the tap that reached each page is recorded, so poll
    time can replay a known route instead of deriving one again. The sweep
    stops the moment it cannot get back to the root, because every tap it
    makes is meant for a page it has verified it is on, and the reading then
    says it is not complete (see :class:`MenuReading`).

    The reading also says how far the walk got, and the walk says it in the
    log, once per run per display on warning where it found no menu and on
    info where it did. A display that stops answering partway is one of the
    ways it finds none: the panel is put back as usual and the reading
